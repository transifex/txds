# Principles

Transifex Design System has ten universal design axioms, which offer opportunities to solve users needs and leverage the experience of the product. These axioms should be used during all phases of design, from design thinking and ideating to sketching, prototyping, and evaluating.

Our design approach as we defined it after looking our core values, our people and our products is:

#### ▣ Simple
Provide no more than is needed. Prefer to be simple and explicit than complex and implicit, even if it feels obvious.

#### △ Authentic
Design genuine experiences. Follow and learn from current conventions and trends but also differentiate and think ahead.

#### ◈ Inventive
Follow a fuzzy logic when needed and try to invent something new and awesome today. Be resourceful and playful.

#### ⚭ Durable
Design for the future. Prefer solutions with a much higher lifespan that will be functional and compatible in the near future.

#### ▦ Modular
Design components that can operate and scale independently as atoms, combine to create new molecules but also inter-communicate effectively inside an organism.

#### ▥ Consistent
Design reusable solutions to solve similar problems and don’t repeat yourself. Use a coherent user interface library.


#### ◳ Efficient
Make it easy for users to find and do what they came to do. Promote one scope per page.


#### ✱ Clear
Design clear and elegant interfaces. Use color, visualizations and graphic elements to denote value, actions or important context. Be functional, not fictional.


#### ◌ Inclusive
Aim to make the product or services accessible to as many users as possible in as many diverse environments as possible. 


#### ⌘ Multicultural 
Design for a global audience. Consider content and design that goes beyond language localization and incorporate linguistic, physical, business and cultural aspects.
